# THE GATES OF HELL

This **SIMPLE SHELL** program was written entirely in C as a milestone project for ALX Africa Software Engineering. It replicates functionalities of UNIX shell (sh).

## Testing

* Compile it using ```gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 ../*.c -o hsh```
* run ```./hsh```

### Usage

After compilation, the resulting program can run stand-alone, either in interactive or non-interactive mode.
